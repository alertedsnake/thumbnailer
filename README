This little program is a basic image thumbnailer - it simply generates
thumbnails for the images in a given directory.

Only slightly nicer than doing something like:

for i in *jpg ; do convert -geometry 100x $i ${i/.jpg/.thumb.jpg} ; done


At one point, this also generated some HTML along with the image, but I don't
currently have a use for that.
